dar-backup-image v0.5.12 â€” First Public Release (Developer Preview)

GitHub: v0.5.12

This is the first tagged release of the `dar-backup` Docker image, providing a containerized environment for dar-backup with secure defaults, a unified build process, and an automated test suite.

Highlights

    Single Dockerfile build
    Simplified image build, replacing multiple legacy build paths.

    Security-focused

        Runs as a non-root user (daruser, UID 1000).

        Removed pip, setuptools, wheel, and unnecessary tooling from the runtime image.

        Cleaned intermediate layers and minimized dependencies.

        Verified clean (no high/critical CVEs) with Scout.

    Improved testing

        Full end-to-end test suite covering FULL, DIFF, and INCR backups using stateful and stateless datasets.

        SHA256-based tracing ensures test reproducibility and data integrity validation.

        New test cases validate restore functionality and .db creation via the manager tool.

    Ready for developer use
    While not yet production-certified, this image is now stable enough for test, evaluation, and integration work.
