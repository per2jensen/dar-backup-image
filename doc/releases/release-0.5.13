dar-backup-image v0.5.13 – Leaner, Smarter, Fully Tested

This release focuses on streamlined testing, smaller images, and better build tooling while retaining security and stability.
Highlights

    Image size reduced from 270 MB → 143 MB

        Switched to python3-minimal and removed unnecessary Python packaging tools.

        Cleaned up locales, man pages, caches, and build artifacts.

        Combined Docker RUN steps to reduce intermediate layers.

    Security preserved

        Retained dist-upgrade during image build to ensure all base packages are patched.

    Testing overhauled

        Legacy Bash-based test suite migrated to pytest (v7.4.4) with proper fixtures and conftest.py.

        Stateful backup chain tests (FULL → DIFF → INCR) combined into a single cohesive test.

        SHA256 hashes printed during test runs for easy integrity verification.

        Tests now run quickly via make test using the dev build.

    Developer experience improvements

        Added make size-report to analyze image layer sizes (normalized to MB, with readable output).

        Integrated automatic image size audit into make final builds — each release build shows a full layer breakdown.

        Added make dev-nuke to prune all cache and layers for clean troubleshooting builds.
