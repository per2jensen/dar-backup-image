## v0.5.14 – July 24, 2025

### Highlights

- **Custom backup definitions (`-d` / `--backup-definition`)**  
  `run-backup.sh` now supports selecting specific backup definitions, so you can maintain separate datasets or policies.  
  Archives are named automatically as `<definition>_<type>_<date>.<slice>.dar`. Falls back to `default` if none is given.

- **Docker Hub verification (`make test-pulled`)**  
  New Makefile target to pull a released image from Docker Hub and run the full pytest suite — no local build needed.

- **Improved usability & documentation**  
  - README now explains directory overrides, UID/GID handling, and three typical setups (personal, group, service).  
  - Usage examples for custom backup definitions.  
  - `run-backup.sh` shows which definition is used at runtime.

### Internal

- Refactored `run-backup.sh` to handle `-d` cleanly and generate `default` if missing.
- Test suite updated:
  - Verifies FULL → DIFF → INCR chains for multiple definitions.
  - Ensures DIFF/INCR only run when prerequisites exist.
  - Confirms archive naming and Docker Hub images pass tests.
