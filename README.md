## üóÑÔ∏è dar-backup-image

`dar-backup-image` is a Docker image that bundles the powerful dar (Disk ARchiver) utility with the robust Python wrapper `dar-backup`. Together, they provide a flexible, automated, and verifiable backup solution suited for long-term data retention.

This image makes it easy to run `dar-backup` in a clean, isolated container environment ‚Äî perfect for use in cron jobs, systemd timers, or CI pipelines. Whether you're backing up from FUSE-based cloud storage or verifying years-old archives, this image delivers consistent, reproducible results without requiring dar or Python tooling on the host.

At its core is `dar-backup`, a Python-powered CLI that wraps dar and par2 for reliable full, differential, and incremental backups. It validates archives, performs restore tests, manages catalog databases, and optionally generates redundancy files to protect against bit rot.

üîß Highlights

    Automated backup logic with dar-backup: tested, restore-verified, and redundancy-enhanced

    Stateless and portable: no installation required on the host system

    Ideal for FUSE filesystems: works without root, designed for user-space storage

    Includes par2 for integrity protection

    Ready for CI / cron / systemd: just mount volumes and go

>The default entrypoint of this image is `dar-backup`, meaning any docker run invocation without a command will start dar-backup directly. You can also run dar, par2, or a shell interactively by overriding the entrypoint.

Use `dar-backup-image` to centralize and simplify your backup operations ‚Äî with restore confidence built in.

## Description

A minimal, Dockerized backup runner using dar (Disk ARchive) and dar-backup, ready for automated or manual archive creation and restore.

This is early, the `dar-backup` images are not tested well, do not trust it too much. It will mature over time :-)

This image includes:

- dar
- par2
- python3
- gosu
- [dar-backup](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup) (my `dar` Python based wrapper)
- Clean, minimal Ubuntu 24.04 base (~170 MB)
- CIS-aligned permissions and user-drop via gosu

## License

This repo is licensed under the GPL 3.0 License

If you are not familiar with the license take a look at the included LICENSE file in the repository.

## How to test

```bash
# make new base and development image
make all-dev

# run FULL, DIFF and INCR backups in a temp directory
make test
```

## üîß Image Tags

Some  images are put on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/per2jensen/dar-backup/tags).

The [Release procedure](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/doc/Release.md) results in two things:

- An image pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/per2jensen/dar-backup/tags).
- Metadata about the image put in [build-history.md](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/doc/build-history.json).

## üß∞ Volumes / Runtime Configuration

The default dar-backup.conf baked into the image assumes the directories mentioned below.

The locations should be mounted with actual directories on your machine for backups.

|Directories in file system| Directories in container| Purpose   |
|------------------------- | ------------------------| ---------------------------------------------|
|/some/dir/to/backup/      | `/data`                 | Source directory for backup                  |
|/keep/backups/here/       | `/backup`               | `dar` archives and .par2 files are put here  |
|/restore/tests/           | `/restore`              | Optional restore target                      |
|[/backup/definitions/](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup?tab=readme-ov-file#backup-definition-example)      | `/backup.d`             | Contains backup definition files             |

The mapping between physical directories on your file system and the expected directories inside the container is performed by the `-v /physical/dir:/container/dir` options  (see example below).

## üöÄ Usage Example

Determine if you want to built an image yourself, or use one of mine from Docker Hub.

```bash
# make a container
$ make FINAL_VERSION=0.5.6 DAR_BACKUP_VERSION=0.8.0 dev  # make a development image

# check
$ docker images |grep "^dar-backup "
dar-backup              0.5.6         9323c1007e66   About a minute ago   174MB

# Set IMAGE to your own
export IMAGE=dar-backup:0.5.6  # your own locally build image

# Or set IMAGE to one of mine on Docker Hub
export IMAGE=per2jensen/dar-backup:0.5.6
```

Now run `dar-backup` in the container

```bash
# Run it (from script or manually)
# Configuration
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/test-data          # the data to backup
export BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/test-backups     # the directory that keeps the backups
export RESTORE_DIR=/tmp/test-restore    # the directory used for restore tests during backup verification
export BACKUP_D_DIR=/tmp/test-backup.d  # the directory keeping the `backup definitions`

docker run --rm \
  -e RUN_AS_UID=$(id -u) \
  -v "$DATA_DIR":/data \
  -v "$BACKUP_DIR":/backup \
  -v "$RESTORE_DIR":/restore \
  -v "$BACKUP_D_DIR":/backup.d \
  "$IMAGE" \
  -F --log-stdout --config /etc/dar-backup/dar-backup.conf
```

The `--config` option to `dar-backup` is referencing the [baked-in config file](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/dar-backup.conf). In other words, the config file is part of the container image. To use another config file you have multiple options:

- Modify the [baked-in](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/dar-backup.conf) and build a new image.
- Use --config option to point to another (for example: /backup/dar-backup.conf, which in the example above means you physically put it on "$BACKUP_DIR"/dar-backup.conf)

The container uses gosu to drop root privileges. Pass -e RUN_AS_UID=$(id -u) to run as your own user inside the container.

## run-backup.sh

This script runs a backup using a dar-backup Docker image.

It runs a backup based on the specified type (FULL, DIFF, INCR)
with the following features:

### 1

Using the baked in [dar-backup.conf](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/dar-backup.conf) file (se more [here](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup?tab=readme-ov-file#config)).

### 2

Uses the .darrc file from the [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/dar-backup/) added to the image,
   see image [details here](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup-image/blob/main/doc/build-history.json)
  
   .darrc [contents](https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup/blob/main/v2/src/dar_backup/.darrc)

### 3

It print log messages to stdout.

### 4

Expected directory structure when running this script:

```text
   WORKDIR/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/           # Where backups are stored
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup.d/          # Backup definitions
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Data to backup
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restore/           # Where restored files will be placed
```

If envvar WORKDIR is set, the script uses that as the base directory.

If WORKDIR is not set, the script uses the directory where the script is located as the base directory.

### 5

If IMAGE is not set, the script defaults to `dar-backup:dev`.

   You can see available images on [Docker Hub here)(https://hub.docker.com/r/per2jensen/dar-backup/tags)

   If RUN_AS_UID is not set, it defaults to the current user's UID.
    - running the script as root is not allowed, the script will exit with an error.

### 6

You can configure the directory layout by setting the following environment variables:

- DAR_BACKUP_DIR: Directory for backups (default: WORKDIR/backups)

- DAR_BACKUP_DATA_DIR: Directory for data to backup (default: WORKDIR/data) 

- DAR_BACKUP_D_DIR: Directory for backup definitions (default: WORKDIR/backup.d)

- DAR_BACKUP_RESTORE_DIR: Directory for restored files (default: WORKDIR/restore)

### Usage

```bash
WORKDIR=/path/to/your/workdir IMAGE=`image` ./run-backup.sh -t FULL|DIFF|INCR
```

## üîç Discover Image Metadata

Learn what's inside the `dar-backup` image: program versions, build metadata, and available versions.

---

### üß™ 1. Check Tool Versions

Run the image with different entrypoints to check the bundled versions of `dar-backup`, `dar`, and `par2`:

```bash
IMAGE=per2jensen/dar-backup:0.5.1

# dar-backup version
docker run --rm --entrypoint "dar-backup" "$IMAGE" -v

# dar version
docker run --rm --entrypoint dar "$IMAGE" --version

# par2 version
docker run --rm --entrypoint par2 "$IMAGE" --version

# Or get them all in one go:
docker run --rm --entrypoint "" "$IMAGE" \
  bash -c "dar-backup -v; dar --version; par2 --version"
```

### üè∑Ô∏è 2. Inspect Image Labels

```bash
docker pull per2jensen/dar-backup:0.5.1
docker inspect per2jensen/dar-backup:0.5.1 | jq '.[0].Config.Labels'

{
  "org.opencontainers.image.base.created": "2025-06-19T13:38:32Z",
  "org.opencontainers.image.created": "2025-06-19T13:38:32Z",
  "org.opencontainers.image.description": "Container for DAR-based backups using dar-backup",
  "org.opencontainers.image.ref.name": "ubuntu",
  "org.opencontainers.image.source": "https://hub.docker.com/r/per2jensen/dar-backup",
  "org.opencontainers.image.version": "0.5.1"
}
```

### üì¶ 3. List Available Image Tags

```bash
# Show first 100 available tags
curl -s 'https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/per2jensen/dar-backup/tags?page_size=100' \
  | jq -r '.results[].name' | sort -V
```

## Image deep diving

Although `dar-backup` is the primary CLI inside the container, you can also run dar directly from the image to take manual backups or inspect archives ‚Äî perfect for advanced workflows or testing.

Here's a minimal example of how to use dar directly:

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/test-data
export BACKUP_DIR=tmp/test-backups
export IMAGE=per2jensen/dar-backup:0.5.6
touch /tmp/test-data/TEST.txt

docker run --rm -v "$DATA_DIR":/data -v "$BACKUP_DIR":/backup --entrypoint dar "$IMAGE" -c /backup/myarchive -R /data
```

Example output

```bash
No terminal found for user interaction. All questions will be assumed a negative answer (less destructive choice), which most of the time will abort the program.

 --------------------------------------------
 1 inode(s) saved
   including 0 hard link(s) treated
 0 inode(s) changed at the moment of the backup and could not be saved properly
 0 byte(s) have been wasted in the archive to resave changing files
 0 inode(s) with only metadata changed
 0 inode(s) not saved (no inode/file change)
 0 inode(s) failed to be saved (filesystem error)
 0 inode(s) ignored (excluded by filters)
 0 inode(s) recorded as deleted from reference backup
 --------------------------------------------
 Total number of inode(s) considered: 1
 --------------------------------------------
 EA saved for 0 inode(s)
 FSA saved for 1 inode(s)
 --------------------------------------------
```

This shows that even without dar-backup, you can still invoke dar manually ‚Äî helpful for debugging, recovery scenarios, or power-user workflows.

    üß† Tip: You can also run par2 directly using --entrypoint par2 if needed.

## Common `dar-backup` commands

### Full backup

dar-backup --full-backup

### Diff backup (requires prior FULL)

dar-backup --differential-backup

### Incremental backup (requires DIFF)

dar-backup --incremental-backup

### List available archives

dar-backup --list

### List contents of a backup

dar-backup --list-contents <archive_name>

### Restore

dar-backup --restore <archive_name>
